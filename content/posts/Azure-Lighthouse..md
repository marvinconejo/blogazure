Azure Lighthouse became generally available in July this year and we have seen a tremendous response from Azure managed service provider communities who are excited about the scale and precision of management that the Azure platform now enables with cross tenant management. Similarly, customers are empowered with architecting precise and just enough access levels to service providers for their Azure environments. Both customers and partners can decide on the precise scope of the projection.

Azure Lighthouse enables partners to manage multiple customer tenants from within a single control plane, which is their environment. This enables consistent application of management and automation across hundreds of customers and monitoring and analytics to a degree that was unavailable before. The capability works across Azure services (that are Azure Resource Manager enabled) and across licensing motion. Context switching is a thing of the past now.
